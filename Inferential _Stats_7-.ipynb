    " So to ease this process what we do is that we take a sample set of heights from the total population set. Let assume that we took a sample set of 10k heights then its mean will be all the heights divided by 10 thousand which is a lot more easier and productive as it saves a lot of time.\n",

    "The field of statistics is based on fact that it is highly impossible to collect the data of entire population. Instead of doing that we can gather a subset of data from a population and use the statistics of that sample to draw conclusions about the population.\n",
    "In practice, the unexpected appearance of normal distribution from a population distribution is skewed (even heavily skewed). Many practices in statistics such as hypothesis testing make this assumption that the population on which they work is normally distributed.\n",
    "This assumption basically simplifies matters and we overcome the problem of the data belonging to the population which is not normal.\n",
    "Thus, even we don’t know the shape our distribution where our data comes from but according to Central Limit Theorem we can treat sampling distribution of any population as normal. Ofcourse, for the conclusions of the Central Limit Theorem to hold we need sample size to be large enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Central Limit Theorem is used a lot in Data Analysis tasks and by using central limit theorem we can get the mean of any type of population distribution as long as the mean and the variance of the population distribution is finite.\n",
